        <p>There had been minor tremors for a couple of weeks before the worms attacked, but tragically they were too minor, if anything. You could barely feel them at surface level, and only if you were basically right on top of the epicenter, so the warnings were essentially ignored. Nobody was even particularly interested in this new development, even the seismologists who discovered and were monitoring the tremors weren't that worried by them yet, it just didn't seem like that big a deal. Some people didn't even really feel the tremors up until a day or two before the worms breached, and even then they weren't very strong tremors at that point. So there was no response, no plan of action, no panic, and therefore obviously no evacuations. Giant worms effectively crept up on New York from underneath while simultaneously announcing their arrival the whole time. They ambushed New York, loudly, and literally nobody saw it coming. But who could blame them? It's not every day an army of worms a hundred times their normal size attack your city, it's probably fair enough that no one was prepared for this particular unprecedented hypothetical situation that would <em>definitely never happen.</em> 
        </br>It was a little after 5 in the morning on a rainy Sunday when the worms attacked. New York never sleeps but most new yorkers had been enjoying their weekend, and many were sleeping off a late night of drinking and bad choices. The deepest sleepers might even have slept right through the earthquakes that shook the city as the worms made their grand entrance, but the majority would have been rudely awoken, hangover or not. What faced them upon awakening was a nightmare so bad I imagine many were convinced they were still asleep and dreaming. Giant worms began to emerged through holes in the ground. They didn't move with amazing speed when they were tunnelling, but on the surface they were a different beast. They were essentially a noodle of pure muscle with a big mouth full of indestructable teeth, they presumedly came from the belly of the earth, you know - <em>where lava lives</em>, and by all accounts appeared to be completely indestructable. Each one that emerged seemed to be bigger than the last as what must have been hundreds of giant worms ate their way out into the morning rainfall. 
        </br>Some of them came up directly beneath skyscrapers, tunneling their way through the core. Concrete or reinforced steel, it didn't matter, these 'permanent' structures offered little resistance as the monsters methodically devoured whatever was in their way. It wasn't long at all before buildings began to fall around New York as their structural integrity was quite literally undermined. The roads very quickly became blocked with wrecked vehicles and fallen buildings, and nevermind the rampaging beasts, the holes they left behind made getting anywhere a very difficult task. Many people fled to the very tops of buildings, hoping the one they were in wasnt targetted, and perhaps they would be rescued. Most took to the streets and tried to get away from the immediate danger they were in, only to stampede directly into another even more deadlier situation. Some escaped on boats, and some made it across a bridge to safety, but those avenues disappeared very quickly and most New Yorkers found themselves completely trapped with nowhere to go.
