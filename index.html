      <h2>Chapter 1</br><div class="break"></div><span class="smaller">Nowhere to run,</br>Nowhere to hide.</span></h2>
        <p>There had been a series of sporadioc minor tremors for a couple of weeks before the worms attacked, but tragically they weren't adequate warning of the carnage steadily squirming its way towards them from deep beneath their feet. You could barely feel them at surface level, and only if you were basically right on top of the epicenter, so they were essentially ignored. Nobody was even particularly interested in this new development, even the seismologists who discovered and were monitoring the tremors weren't that worried by them yet, it just didn't seem like that big a deal. Some people didn't even really feel the tremors up until a day or two before the worms breached, and even then they weren't very strong tremors at that point. So there was no response, no plan of action, no panic, and therefore obviously no evacuations. Giant worms effectively crept up on New York from underneath while simultaneously announcing their arrival the whole time, and the city was full to the brim. By all accounts the worms ambushed New York, loudly, and literally nobody saw it coming. Not even crazy conspiracy nuts on the internet, who believe just about anything it seems, had any theories about giant worms eating New York. But who could blame them? It's not every day an army of worms a hundred times their normal size attack your city, it's probably fair enough that no one was prepared for this particular unprecedented hypothetical situation that would <em>definitely never happen.</em></br> 
        </br>It was a little after 5 in the morning on a rainy Sunday when the worms attacked. New York may historically never sleep but most new yorkers had been throroughly enjoying their weekend, and many were sleeping off a late night of drinking and/or bad choices. The deepest sleepers might even have stayed that way right through the earthquakes that shook the city as the worms made their grand entrance, but the majority would have been rudely awoken, hangover or not. What faced you upon awakening was a nightmare and you would be forgiven if you were convinced you were still asleep and dreaming as huge worms began to break out into the streets through holes in the ground. They didn't move with amazing speed when they were tunnelling, as they were injesting and throwing around large amounts of material, but on the surface they were a different beast. The worms were essentially a noodle of pure muscle, and at one end there was a big mouth full of menacing-looking teeth. They presumedly came from the belly of the earth, you know - <em>where lava lives</em>, and by all accounts appeared to be completely indestructable. And they were hungry. These were worms with motivation and purpose. They weren't popping up to cheerily say 'ello ello whats all this then' - they were kicking down your front door and eating all your things saying 'oh sorry did i also eat you, your family and all your neighbours? ..oops!' These worms meant business, each one that emerged seemed to be bigger than the last, and in some places there were so many it was hard to tell where one ended and the next started. There was just a writhing mass of twisting, thrashing destruction. Like a series of living tornados working their way through the boroughs. New York city was awake, and fully awake now as a ferocious horde of spagetti ate its way out into the grey morning rainfall.</br>
        </br>A lot of worms came up in the streets but many of the worms came up directly beneath skyscrapers, tunneling their way through the core. Concrete or reinforced steel, it didn't matter, these 'permanent' structures offered little resistance as the monsters methodically devoured whatever was in their way. It wasn't long at all before buildings began to fall around New York as their structural integrity was quite literally undermined. The roads very quickly became blocked with wrecked vehicles and fallen buildings, nevermind the rampaging beasts or the holes they left behind, which made getting anywhere a very difficult task. Many people fled to the very tops of buildings, hoping the one they were in wasnt targetted, and perhaps they would be rescued. Most took to the streets and tried to get away from the immediate danger they were in, only to stampede directly into another even more deadlier situation. Some lucky people escaped on boats, and some made it across a bridge to safety, but those avenues disappeared very quickly and most New Yorkers found themselves completely trapped with nowhere to go, surrounded by killing machines that for some reason appeared to be a scaled up version of your common earthworm on steroids!
